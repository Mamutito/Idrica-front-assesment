# Post Management Application

## Introduction

This project is a React-based application for managing posts, developed as part of a technical assessment. It demonstrates proficiency in modern web development technologies and best practices.

## Features

- CRUD operations for posts
- User authentication
- Internationalization (English and Spanish)
- Responsive design with light/dark theme
- Data visualization using Highcharts
- State management with Redux Toolkit
- API integration using RTK Query

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
- React Router for routing
- i18next for internationalization
- Highcharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mamutito/Idrica-front-assesment.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd post-management-app
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

- Login sample (Username: user, Password: password)
- Non-authenticated users can view posts
- Authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on posts and view comments
- Use the language switcher in the header to change between English and Spanish
- Toggle between light and dark themes using the theme switcher in the header

## Testing

While the project doesn't currently include end-to-end tests using Cypress as requested in the assessment, I acknowledge the importance of this requirement. I have experience with Playwright for end-to-end testing and am eager to learn and implement Cypress tests for this position.

I understand that end-to-end testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and functionality of web applications, and I'm committed to expanding my skills in this area. Given the opportunity, I would be excited to learn Cypress and implement comprehensive end-to-end tests for this position.

## Future Improvements

- Implement end-to-end and visual regression tests using Cypress
- Enhance error handling and add more detailed loading states
- Improve accessibility features
- Add more detailed translations and support for additional languages

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my skills in React development, state management, API integration, and responsive design. While I wasn't able to implement the Cypress tests due to time constraints and lack of familiarity with the tool, I believe the overall quality and functionality of the application showcase my abilities as a frontend developer.

I'm eager to discuss the project further and explain my approach to solving the various challenges presented in this assessment. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to any feedback or questions you may have.
